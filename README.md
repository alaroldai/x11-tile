# x11-tile

A small utility for controlling window positions based on fractions of screen size, for example centering the current window and giving it a quarter of the available space:


`x11-tile move-window-on-output 1/4 1/4 1/2 1/2`


The intended use case is that this be paired with e.g. KDE's global keyboard shortcuts, or the equivalent system in other desktop environments.


(This is basically trying to accomplish the same task as my existing Hammerspoon setup on macos)
